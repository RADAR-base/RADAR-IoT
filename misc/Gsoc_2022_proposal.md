## Background:
The [RADAR-IoT](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-IoT) is a lightweight, flexible, configurable and highly extensible framework for IoT devices (like a raspberry pi)
that allows for capturing sensor data (and potentially other devices) and consuming it in different ways
including sending it to the [RADAR-base mHealth platform](https://radar-base.org/) backend. The gateway framework is highly decoupled and extensible. The architecture is shown below.

Presently, the RADAR-base platform focuses on personal sensing, these devices are typically battery powered and carried on the user. 
Wearable devices available for integration are limited by the vendor availability of SDKs and REST-APIs, 
however, for static IoT sensors there is a very large range of sensor modalities and providers, a significant improvement to the RADAR-base platform
would enable the use of these sensors opening up a wide array of use cases within the health and other domains. 
A single platform to collect, and analyse in real-time, ambulatory personal data (phone active/passive RMT, wearable data) 
in parallel with static IoT sensor data provides a holistic 360Â° view of both personal and environmental state previously not possible.

The IoT gateway framework for RADAR-base differentiates itself from related work by being device, sensor and programming language agnostic, 
supporting all types of common IoT input-output protocols, being open-source, modular and easily extensible, providing support for multiple data sinks 
(like mHealth platform, on-device AI and ML, dashboard and more), interoperability, providing industry-leading security and medical level privacy, 
and providing integration to a well established open-source mHealth cloud platform for data collection, aggregation, 
transformation and heavyweight analytics with different types of data sources like wearables, IoT sensors, mobile apps, eCRFs.

The framework is currently in the Proof-Of-Concept (POC) stage and has been tested working in a staging environment. 
We want to finalise the framework and make it production-ready. 
This will involve working on core aspects of the framework like sensor states machines, M2M communication protocols and 
implementing advanced visibility into the framework.
