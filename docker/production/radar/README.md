## RADAR-base platform

The RADAR-IoT framework supports various destinations for consumed data. One of the core one is [RADAR-Base platform](https://radar-base.org). 
The method to deploy the platform in production take a look at the [official docs](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Docker/tree/master/dcompose-stack/radar-cp-hadoop-stack).

**Note:** There is also a [Kubernetes deployment](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Kubernetes) available if deploying on a very large scale.
